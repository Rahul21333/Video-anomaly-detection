# Video-anomaly-detection

Video anomaly detection has significant potential in various applications, 
including surveillance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. Current techniques, 
such as deep learning algorithms, have shown promising results in accurately 
identifying anomalies in video data, thereby improving security, safety, and 
efficiency.<br>
Video anomaly detection is carried out using Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) with densenet121 as classifier. The model architecture combines 
the power of a pre-trained DenseNet121 feature extractor with a custom classifier, 
demonstrating a robust approach for capturing intricate features and discerning 
complex patterns in images. <br>
The model architecture combines the power of a pre-trained DenseNet121 feature extractor with a custom classifier, demonstrating a 
robust approach for capturing intricate features and discerning complex patterns 
in images. It gives the accuracy about 95.89% with AUC-ROC characteristics 
curve while other models that trained with multiple instance learning shows 
75.41% accuracy with video as inputs, LSTM shows about 86.4% and multilayer 
perception shows accuracy about 90.2%.
